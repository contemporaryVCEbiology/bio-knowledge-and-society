                        <p>Ashley is a Research Officer working at the Bio21 Institute, The University of Melbourne for the past six years.  Her laboratory is investigating the naturally occurring bacterium, Wolbachia that has been artificially introduced into <i>A. aegypti</i> to decrease the ability of this mosquito to transmit dengue viruses between people. Ashley is originally from Canada where she completed her Master of Science (Environmental Science) and Bachelor of Science (Biology) degrees at Memorial University, Canada.</p>
