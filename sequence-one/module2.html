    <h3>Teacher background information</h3>
    <div class="clearfix">
        <div class="left">
            <p>In Module 1, students learned about types of mosquito-borne diseases, how they are transmitted and the current treatment options. This module introduces students to the contemporary science that is being developed to treat mosquitoes (the vector) of mosquito-borne diseases. The two methods that will be introduced are the ‘natural’ Wolbachia method and the genetically modified method developed by Oxitec. This module will address key knowledge found in VCE Biology Unit 4 by referring to work scientists are doing to combat mosquitoes. This will give students a real-life example and hopefully make the connection between science and society. This topic is particularly relevant in society today because MBD affect millions of people in world. Additionally, MBD’s such as the Zika virus is getting heavy media attention around the world.</p>
            <p>If you have been working through this resource students have been learning about mosquito-borne diseases and the methods to prevent these diseases e.g. the use of pesticides, life cycle disruption, personal protection.  Now we are going to look at how scientific research is trying to combat this problem. As you know by now, there is no vaccine for dengue fever, so scientists within Australia and around the world have been applying some interesting cutting-edge science to address the spread of this disease. Two methods will be studied: the ‘natural’ Wolbachia method, and the Oxitec genetically modified mosquito method. Videos are used to introduce these two strategies for mosquito control.</p>

            <p>Students compare the Wolbachia and Oxitec methods using a variety of resources including newspaper articles, scientific journals, videos and web pages.  At least one journal article should be used!</p>
            <p>The following questions are to be set by the teacher to direct the students in their research</p>

                <li>If you were a researcher which method would you choose and why?</li>

                        <p>Topic - Dengue virus, Vector, Transmission, current control strategies, ethics</p>
                        <p>The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for spreading the virus between humans. It draws up blood from an infected person, and festers in the mosquito for 12 days. When it bites its victim, the mosquito transfers the virus through its saliva to the next victim. Four hundred years ago, dengue was only found in Africa, but now, with global travel, we see it spread all over the world.</p>
                        <p>Professors Ritchie and O'Neill, have been working on a way of curbing mosquito populations. They discovered that by injecting mosquitoes with a bacterium called Wolbachia, they could stop the dengue virus from replicating in the insect.</p>
                        <p>This video explains the overall, Wolbachia technique. There is extra information in this video which describes a blood test for dengue fever.</p>

                        <p>Using advanced genetics and molecular biology Oxitec has developed a new and innovative solution to controlling the dangerous mosquito, <i>Aedes aegypti</i>.</p>
                        <p>The Oxitec solution harnesses the natural instincts of male mosquitoes to find females in the wild. Oxitec has used genetic engineering to create ‘self-limiting’ male insects which seek out and mate with females. After an Oxitec male mosquito has successfully mated with a wild female, any offspring that result will not survive to adulthood, so the mosquito population declines.</p>

                        <p>The use of genetically modified (GM) insects for control of human disease can be consistent with common ethical norms of international society to reduce human suffering. This paper considers a range of ethical issues including animal rights, informed consent, community consensus and environmental viewpoints. Each community needs to decide its own priorities for methodology of disease policy guidance for ethical genetic engineering, and to negotiate with neighbouring countries. The approach to genetically modify insects raises few intrinsic ethical issues; however, important environmental and human health concerns need to be assessed before release of any GM insects. The policy that each community adopts should be the product of open dialogue involving all sectors of society. It can be expected that this process will take years and not all communities will endorse genetic control approaches to insect vectors.</p>

Infectious disease is suggested as the focus because it is usually taught early in the course and is always in the news.</p>
