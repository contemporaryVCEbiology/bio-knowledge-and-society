    <h2>Epidemics and Pandemics</h2>
    <p class="intro">This module focuses on establishing a basic understanding of the concepts of epidemics and pandemics. It is expected this could take 30–50 minutes of class time, depending if activities are undertaken. This topic is particularly relevant with the relatively recent emergence of the Zika virus as a disease organism of concern in many countries around the world.</p>

        <h5>Summary</h5>
        <p>Students perform a sequence of six short simulations to model how an infectious disease can spread through a human population.</p>
        <h5>Learning Objectives</h5>
        <p>Students will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>state that some diseases are the result of infection.</li>
            <li>describe the risks associated with biological hazards, such as viruses.</li>
            <li>name ways that infectious disease can be prevented, controlled, or cured.</li>
            <li>graphically represent data created in a classroom simulation.</li>
            <li>describe how a disease can spread rapidly among a population.</li>
            <li>explain how preventive measures help defend against infection.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="activity"> 
        <p>Activity 1.3 - <strong>The Infection Game: The Shape of Change</strong></p>
        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>Students play a game that simulates the spread of an epidemic.<br>  <a class="download" href="https://flusurvey.ie/media/uploads/Shape5InfectionGameSF.pdf">The Infection Game: The Shape of Change <small>(329KB pdf)</small></a></p>
        <p>The behavior we see in the game could represent bacteria spreading through an animal population, a virus spreading through a computer network, a rumor spreading through a school, the adoption of a fad in a country, or any other type of contagious agent. Social studies concepts could include the spread of disease in the New World, and the spread of ideas, social movements, or revolutions. The spread of disease can also be discussed from the science point of view. The disease in question might be a cold virus, the flu, smallpox, or AIDS. Mathematics skills include drawing and interpreting graphs, fitting a curve through data, and looking at patterns of behavior over time. Combine two classes to play this game. It takes at least 35 players to generate clear patterns of behavior.</p>

                    <p>This lesson will talk about what an endemic disease is and how it is different from an epidemic. We'll also discuss how an epidemic differs from a pandemic. Finally, we'll look at some examples of each to help solidify these points.</p>

                    <p>Mosquito development and survival is heavily influenced by environmental factors. Even though your class you can study mosquitoes in small rearing containers, environmental conditions can influence mosquito populations on regional and global scales. After discussing the class’s experimental data, introduce a global thinking approach about how large-scale conditions (like climate) can influence mosquito populations, and extend this to the concepts of an epidemic and pandemic. The terms epidemic and pandemic usually refer to the rate of infection, the area that is affected or both.</p>

    <h4>Extension to Mosquito Borne Diseases</h4>
    <p>These resources and activities use the theme of mosquito-borne diseases to develop an understanding of epidemics and pandemics.</p>

                <p><strong>Yellow Fever: Resetting the yellow fever strategy</strong></p>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>This page highlights the issue of yellow fever and how it is reemerging. There is a short video here explaining the situation.</p>
                    <p>Summary: Changes in the way humans live and work, and the resurgence of mosquito vectors, particularly the Aedes aegypti mosquito (which spreads Zika, dengue fever and chikungunya), have raised the global risk of yellow fever. Two large yellow fever outbreaks in Angola and Democratic Republic of the Congo are now under control, but these are just warnings of bigger outbreaks to come if action is not taken.</p> 
                    <p>A coalition of partners working to stop yellow fever outbreaks met in Geneva on 12 September 2016 to develop a new strategy - Eliminating Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE). This strategy aims to protect the populations most at risk, ensure a ready supply of yellow fever vaccine, build resilience in urban centres and prevent international spread.</p>

                    <p>Mosquito development and survival are heavily influenced by environmental factors. Environmental conditions can influence mosquito populations on regional and global scales. Introduce a global thinking approach about how large scale conditions (like climate) can influence mosquito populations, and extend this to the concepts of an epidemic and pandemic. The terms epidemic and pandemic usually refer to the rate of infection, the area that is affected or both.</p>
                    <p>Epidemic: An epidemic is defined as an illness or health-related issue that is showing up in more cases than would normally be expected.</p>
                    <p>Pandemic: In the case of a pandemic, even more of the population is affected than in an epidemic.</p>
                    <p>Extend the concepts of an epidemic and pandemic to mosquito-borne disease. What environmental conditions could cause an epidemic? A pandemic? Based on the mosquito life cycle and its biology, what may be some ways to control mosquitoes and reduce/prevent vector-borne disease outbreaks? If desired (and time allowing) extend this concept to current events.</p>
